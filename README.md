# OpenCode for Termux (Android aarch64)

Build system for cross-compiling [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) to run natively on Android devices via [Termux](https://termux.dev/).

OpenCode is an AI-powered coding assistant for the terminal. It uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as its JavaScript runtime and compiles to a standalone binary via `bun build --compile`. Since Bun has no official Android support ([marked "not planned"](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/9)), this project cross-compiles Bun itself from source for Android/aarch64, including the full WebKit/JavaScriptCore engine.

## Install (Termux)

### Option 1: Standalone binary (easiest)

> **Note:** The zip contains a launcher script (`opencode`), the real
> binary (`opencode.bin`), and the native TUI library (`opentui-assets/`).
> The launcher ensures a writable `/tmp` (via `proot` when stock Android
> doesn't provide one) and points the TUI at its native library. Install
> all three to their locations below.

```bash
# Download the latest "opencode-*-android-aarch64.zip" from
#   https://github.com/re200484/opencode-termux/releases/latest
# Then install:

pkg install unzip ripgrep proot
unzip opencode-*-android-aarch64.zip
mkdir -p $PREFIX/libexec/opencode
mv opencode $PREFIX/bin/opencode
chmod +x $PREFIX/bin/opencode
mv opencode.bin $PREFIX/libexec/opencode/opencode.bin
chmod +x $PREFIX/libexec/opencode/opencode.bin
mv opentui-assets $PREFIX/lib/opentui-assets

# Run
opencode
```

### Option 2: Pacman package (recommended if using pacman)

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/guysoft/opencode-termux/releases/latest/download/opencode-aarch64.pkg.tar.xz
pacman -U opencode-*-aarch64.pkg.tar.xz
opencode
```

### Option 3: Deb package

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/guysoft/opencode-termux/releases/latest/download/opencode-aarch64.deb
dpkg -i opencode-*-aarch64.deb
opencode
```

The pacman and deb packages automatically install `ripgrep` and `proot` as dependencies.

### After install

OpenCode needs an AI provider to work. Set one up by configuring your environment:

```bash
# Example: Use Anthropic Claude
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Or use OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Then run
opencode
```

See the [OpenCode docs](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) for full configuration options.

## What This Repo Contains

This repo contains **patch files and build scripts** only -- not the full source trees of Bun or WebKit (which are 1.1GB and 2.7GB respectively). The CI workflow clones upstream repos and applies patches during build.

## What Was Done

This project got OpenCode (a ~136MB standalone binary built on Bun + WebKit/JSC) running on Android/Termux, which required:

1. **Cross-compiling Bun v1.2.13 for Android/aarch64** -- Bun has zero Android support. We patched 33 files across the build system (CMake, Zig), syscall layer, Bionic libc compatibility, JSC/JIT configuration, and linker settings.

2. **Cross-compiling WebKit/JavaScriptCore for Android** -- No prebuilt WebKit exists for Android. We patched 5 files to replace glibc-specific APIs with POSIX/Android equivalents and fixed JIT signal handling for Android's security model.

3. **Fixing Zig's stdlib for Android/Bionic** -- Zig's `sigaction()` and `sigprocmask()` pass a 152-byte struct through Bionic's libc which expects 32 bytes, causing silent memory corruption. Patched to use raw syscalls on Android.

4. **Building libopentui.so for Android** -- OpenCode's TUI renderer depends on OpenTUI, which needed a patch to link Android NDK's libc.so stub so `dlopen()` can resolve symbols at runtime.

5. **Standalone binary surgery** -- Since `bun build --compile` has no Android cross-compilation target, we build a host standalone binary, extract the serialized module graph, and transplant it onto the Android Bun binary. This required understanding and matching the binary format across Bun versions (36-byte vs 52-byte module struct stride).

6. **Cross-compiling ICU 75.1** -- Bun depends on ICU for Unicode/i18n support. Cross-compiled from source for Android.

7. **Cross-compiling TinyCC** -- Bun links against libtcc.a for FFI support. TinyCC's build system assumes a host build, so we cross-compile it separately and inject the library.

### Build pipeline

```
Stage 1: ICU 75.1          ~5 min    (cross-compile for Android)
Stage 2: WebKit/JSC        ~60-90 min (cross-compile, CACHED)
Stage 3: TinyCC            ~1 min    (cross-compile libtcc.a)
Stage 4: Bun binary        ~30-45 min (CMake + Ninja, CACHED)
Stage 5: libopentui.so     ~2 min    (Zig build for aarch64-linux-android)
Stage 6: OpenCode bundle   ~30 sec   (bun build --compile, extract module graph)
Stage 7: Packages          ~10 sec   (zip + pacman + deb)
```

With warm caches (WebKit + Bun cached), CI runs complete in ~4 minutes.

## What Was Patched and Why

### Bun Patches (33 files modified, 2 new files)

Bun has zero Android support. Every patch falls into one of these categories:

#### Build system (CMake/Zig)
- **Android NDK CMake toolchain** (`cmake/toolchains/android-aarch64.cmake`) -- new file. Sets up cross-compiler, sysroot, and find-root paths for the entire Bun build.
- **`-fPIC` instead of `-fno-pic`** -- Android requires position-independent code for all executables and shared libraries (since API 21).
- **PIE linking** -- Android mandates position-independent executables. Changed `-Wl,-no-pie` to `-pie -fPIE`.
- **Rust linker set to NDK's versioned clang** -- The lol-html Rust crate must link against Android's libc, not the host's. Set `CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_LINUX_ANDROID_LINKER` to the NDK's `aarch64-linux-android24-clang`.
- **Zig `translate-c` given NDK sysroot headers** -- Zig has no bundled Android libc headers. Added `-Dandroid-ndk-sysroot` build option that passes NDK include paths to `translate-c`.
- **`-Wno-undefined-var-template`** added -- NDK Clang 19 triggers this warning on some JSC template specializations; with `-Werror`, this becomes a build failure.
- **RELRO kept enabled** -- Desktop Linux disables RELRO (`-Wl,-z,norelro`); Android requires it for security.
- **`CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` replaced with `RUSTFLAGS`** -- CMake can't encode the 0x1F separator that `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` requires. Switched to space-separated `RUSTFLAGS`.

#### TLS alignment (ARM64 Bionic critical fix)
- **`android_tls_align.s`** -- new file. Assembly file that creates a `.tbss` section with 64-byte alignment. Without this, the Zig linker emits `PT_TLS p_align=8`, causing TLS variables to overlap with Bionic's Thread Control Block slots (TPIDR+0..63), corrupting scudo allocator state and crashing on first allocation. This MUST be assembled (not compiled as C) to avoid NDK's emulated TLS (`__emutls`).
- **`android_tls_align.c`** -- backup C version with `__attribute__((aligned(64)))`.

#### Syscall compatibility
- **`close_range()` fallback** -- Android's seccomp filter blocks the `close_range` syscall in app processes (including Termux). Replaced with iteration over `/proc/self/fd`.
- **`preadv2`/`pwritev2` return ENOSYS** -- These syscalls may be blocked by Android's seccomp. Return ENOSYS so the Zig caller falls back to regular `read()`/`write()`.
- **`epoll_pwait2` return ENOSYS** -- Same seccomp issue. Falls back to `epoll_pwait`.
- **`lchmod` return ENOSYS** -- Not available in Bionic.

#### Bionic libc differences
- **`memmem`, `lstat`, `fstat`, `stat` as `@extern` declarations** -- Bionic has these symbols but Zig's `translate-c` doesn't pick them up due to symbol visibility differences. Declared manually.
- **`getifaddrs`/`freeifaddrs` extern wrappers** -- Hidden by `__INTRODUCED_IN` macros at API 24 despite being available. Declared manually via `@extern`.
- **`pthread_setcancelstate` stubbed** -- Bionic has no POSIX thread cancellation.
- **`posix_spawnattr_setsigdefault`/`setsigmask` stubbed** -- Require API 28, we target API 24. Bun uses its own `posix_spawn_bun()` which handles signals directly.
- **No separate `-lpthread`** -- Bionic merges pthread into libc. Removed from link flags.
- **`pwrite64` not used on Android** -- Android/Bionic uses standard `pwrite`, not the glibc compat symbol.
- **`open()` flag fix** -- Removed third argument (mode) from `open()` call when not creating a file (Bionic is stricter about this).

#### JSC/JIT fixes
- **Signal-based VM traps disabled** (`usePollingTraps=true`) -- Android's `debuggerd` crash handler intercepts SIGSEGV before the app's signal handler, so JSC's signal-based traps crash the process instead of being caught.
- **Wasm fault signal handler disabled** (`useWasmFaultSignalHandler=false`) -- Same `debuggerd` issue. Uses explicit bounds checking instead.
- **Options set via `setenv("JSC_*")` BEFORE `JSC::initialize()`** -- `Options::initialize()` resets all options to defaults before reading env vars. Setting options via the API before `initialize()` has no effect.

#### Standalone binary format
- **`StandaloneModuleGraph.zig` Offsets struct extended** -- Added `compile_exec_argv_ptr`, `flags` fields and `Flags` type to match the format produced by host Bun 1.3.2.
- **`find()` function bug fix** -- Fixed variable name from `base_path` to `name` in `isBunStandaloneFilePath()` call (this was actually an upstream bug).

#### Platform detection
- **`isAndroid` constant** added to `env.zig` -- `isLinux and abi == .android`.
- **`isMusl` excludes Android** -- Android uses Bionic, not musl.
- **`bun upgrade` disabled on Android** -- No Android release channel exists.
- **Crash handler**: Enhanced with aarch64 register dump and `/proc/self/maps` output for debugging crashes on Android.
- **File descriptor limit**: Raised on Android (like musl) since Termux has low defaults.
- **npm libc detection**: Reports as `glibc` for package resolution compatibility.

#### Other
- **Post-build test skip** -- CMake tries to run `bun --revision` after linking; can't run aarch64 binary on x86_64 host. Added `if(NOT ANDROID)` guard.
- **`features.json` skip** -- Same issue; generation requires running the binary.
- **CI artifact naming** -- Uses `bun-android-aarch64` triplet.

### WebKit Patches (5 files)

- **`bcmp` replaced with `memcmp`** -- `bcmp` is BSD, not available in Bionic's `libpas`.
- **`aligned_alloc` replaced with `posix_memalign`** -- `aligned_alloc` requires API 28, we target API 24.
- **`backtrace()` stubbed** -- Requires API 33.
- **`pthread_getname_np` stubbed** -- Requires API 26.
- **JSC `InitializeThreading.cpp`** -- Force polling traps and disable Wasm signal handler on Android (same rationale as Bun patches).

### Zig Stdlib Patch (1 file)

- **`sigaction()` and `sigprocmask()` bypass Bionic libc** -- Bionic's `struct sigaction` is 32 bytes with 8-byte `sigset_t`, but Zig's `linux.Sigaction` is 152 bytes with 128-byte `sigset_t`. Passing Zig's struct through Bionic's `sigaction()` causes silent memory corruption. The patch makes these functions use raw `rt_sigaction`/`rt_sigprocmask` syscalls on Android, which correctly handle the kernel's struct layout.

### OpenTUI Patch (1 file)

- **Link NDK `libc.so` stub** -- On Android, the `.so` must have `NEEDED: libc.so` in its ELF headers so `dlopen()` can resolve symbols like `getauxval`. Zig doesn't bundle Android libc, so we directly add the NDK sysroot's `libc.so` stub as a link input.

## How the Standalone Binary Works

Since `bun build --compile` has no Android cross-compilation target, we use a manual approach:

1. Use **host Bun (v1.3.2)** to `bun build --compile` OpenCode for the host platform
2. Extract the serialized **module graph** from the host standalone binary by locating the `\n---- Bun! ----\n` trailer and reading the `Offsets` struct
3. Patch the module graph in-place (fix `undici` global reference)
4. Before bundling, swap x86_64 `libopentui.so` with the ARM64 Android-built version, so it gets embedded in the module graph
5. Append the module graph to our **Android Bun** binary
6. Write a new 8-byte `total_byte_count` footer

The standalone binary format:
```
[Android Bun binary (~96 MB)]
[Module graph bytes (~46 MB)]
[total_byte_count as u64 LE (8 bytes)]
```

### Why host Bun must be pinned to v1.3.2

The `CompiledModuleGraphFile` struct layout changed between Bun versions:
- **Bun <= 1.3.2**: 36-byte stride (4 StringPointers + 3 u8 + 1 padding)
- **Bun >= 1.3.11**: 52-byte stride (6 StringPointers + 4 u8)

The target Android Bun is v1.2.13, which expects 36-byte stride. If the host Bun produces 52-byte modules, the target reads garbage and OOMs immediately (RSS jumps to 1GB on startup).

We can't use Bun 1.2.13 as host either, because OpenCode's monorepo uses `catalog:` workspace protocol (added in Bun 1.3.x) -- `bun install` fails. **Bun 1.3.2 is the sweet spot**: supports `catalog:` AND produces compatible 36-byte modules.

## Known Issues

### Working
- Full TUI rendering (ASCII art logo, prompt, model selector, status bar)
- All backend services (server, provider, file watcher, LSP)
- `opencode --version` outputs correct version
- AI provider connections (tested with Claude, GitHub Copilot)

### Not working / degraded

| Issue | Severity | Details |
|-------|----------|---------|
| File watcher native module | Low | `@parcel/watcher` `.node` binding is compiled for x86_64. Falls back gracefully to polling. Logs: `dlopen failed: "...00000001.node" is for EM_X86_64 (62) instead of EM_AARCH64 (183)` |
| `bun upgrade` | Low | Disabled on Android -- no Android release channel exists upstream |
| TinyCC FFI compilation | Low | `libtcc.a` is linked but TCC's runtime code generation may not produce valid ARM64 code. FFI is not commonly used by OpenCode. |
| SIGPWR signals | None | Many SIGPWR signals appear in strace -- related to Android's power management or Bun's signal handling. Not errors. |

### Workarounds in use

| Workaround | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Host Bun pinned to 1.3.2 | Module graph struct compatibility between host and target Bun versions (see above) |
| `close_range()` replaced with `/proc/self/fd` iteration | Android seccomp blocks the `close_range` syscall in app processes |
| `preadv2`/`pwritev2`/`epoll_pwait2` return ENOSYS | Seccomp may block these; callers fall back gracefully |
| `setenv("JSC_*")` before `JSC::initialize()` | Options API is reset during initialization; env vars survive the reset |
| `.tbss` section with 64-byte alignment in assembly | Forces `PT_TLS p_align=64` to avoid corrupting Bionic's TCB slots |
| Raw `rt_sigaction`/`rt_sigprocmask` syscalls | Zig's struct layout doesn't match Bionic's; bypass libc entirely |
| NDK `libc.so` stub linked into `libopentui.so` | Zig doesn't provision Android libc; explicit link needed for `dlopen` symbol resolution |
| Module graph extracted via trailer, not `process.execPath` | `process.execPath` is unreliable in CI; trailer-based extraction is version-agnostic |

## Upstream PR Opportunities

These patches could potentially be contributed upstream to reduce the maintenance burden of this project.

### Bun (oven-sh/bun) -- Partial upstreaming possible

The Bun team [closed Android support as "not planned"](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/9). However, some patches are clean improvements regardless of Android:

| Patch | Upstreamable? | Notes |
|-------|:---:|-------|
| `StandaloneModuleGraph.zig` `find()` bug fix (`base_path` -> `name`) | Yes | This is an actual bug in upstream Bun |
| `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` -> `RUSTFLAGS` | Maybe | Simpler, avoids CMake 0x1F encoding issues. May have side effects on other platforms. |
| `open()` mode argument fix in `bsd.c` | Yes | Passing a mode to `open()` without `O_CREAT` is technically undefined behavior |
| Android CMake toolchain + `if(ANDROID)` guards | No | Team has explicitly declined Android support |
| Syscall fallbacks (`close_range`, `preadv2`, etc.) | No | Only needed on Android |
| Bionic libc stubs (`pthread_setcancelstate`, etc.) | No | Only needed on Android |
| TLS alignment fix | No | Only needed for Android/aarch64 Bionic |
| JSC signal trap changes | No | Only needed on Android due to debuggerd |
| `isAndroid` environment detection | No | Only needed on Android |

**Recommendation**: Submit a small PR with the `find()` bug fix and the `open()` mode fix. These are correctness improvements that benefit all platforms. The rest is Android-specific and will be rejected per Bun team policy.

### WebKit (oven-sh/WebKit) -- Unlikely

| Patch | Upstreamable? | Notes |
|-------|:---:|-------|
| `bcmp` -> `memcmp` | Maybe | `memcmp` is more portable, but oven-sh may not care since they only target macOS/Linux/Windows |
| `aligned_alloc` -> `posix_memalign` | No | Only needed for Android API < 28 |
| `backtrace()` stub | No | Only needed for Android API < 33 |
| `pthread_getname_np` stub | No | Only needed for Android API < 26 |
| Polling traps + Wasm signal handler | No | Only needed on Android |

**Recommendation**: The `bcmp` -> `memcmp` change is the only candidate, but it's unlikely to be accepted since oven-sh/WebKit is a Bun-specific fork. Not worth the effort.

### Zig (oven-sh/zig) -- Should be upstreamed

| Patch | Upstreamable? | Notes |
|-------|:---:|-------|
| `sigaction`/`sigprocmask` Android bypass | Yes | This is a real bug: Zig's POSIX layer corrupts memory on Android/Bionic due to struct size mismatch |

**Recommendation**: This should be submitted to upstream Zig (ziglang/zig), not just oven-sh/zig. The struct layout mismatch between Zig's `Sigaction` (152 bytes) and Bionic's `struct sigaction` (32 bytes) is a genuine bug that affects any Zig program targeting Android. The fix (using raw syscalls on Android) is clean and correct.

**Note**: oven-sh/zig is Bun's custom Zig fork (v0.14.0), not upstream Zig. The patch should be adapted for current Zig master as well.

### OpenTUI (anomalyco/opentui) -- Should be upstreamed

| Patch | Upstreamable? | Notes |
|-------|:---:|-------|
| NDK libc.so stub linking for Android | Yes | Clean, conditionally compiled, needed for any Android target |

**Recommendation**: Submit a PR to `anomalyco/opentui`. The patch correctly detects Android targets in `build.zig` and links the NDK's `libc.so` stub only when targeting `aarch64-linux-android`. It's a small, self-contained change that enables Android support without affecting other targets.

### What will never make it upstream

- **Bun Android support as a whole** -- The Bun team has explicitly declined this. The CMake toolchain, all `if(ANDROID)` guards, syscall fallbacks, Bionic stubs, and TLS alignment fix are permanent patches we'll need to maintain for every Bun version bump.
- **WebKit Android patches** -- oven-sh/WebKit only supports macOS/Linux/Windows. No incentive to accept Android-specific changes.
- **Host Bun version pinning** -- This is a build-time constraint, not a code patch. It will need to be re-evaluated with each Bun version bump (checking if the `CompiledModuleGraphFile` struct changed).
- **Standalone binary surgery** (module graph extraction + transplant) -- This entire approach is a workaround for the lack of cross-compilation in `bun build --compile`. If Bun ever adds cross-compile targets, this becomes unnecessary.
